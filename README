Simple Minecraft-inspired demo written in Python and Pyglet

# Installing on Max OS/X Lion

Running pyglet 1.1.4 does not run natively on Mac OS/X Mountain Lion (10.8).

When you run:

    $ python main.py

if you see the error:

       /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickTime.framework/QuickTime: mach-o, but wrong architecture

the problem is that you're running a 64-bit python instead of 32 bit python.  You can setup the default
to 32 bit thusly:

    $ defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes

These additional steps gave me a working solution on Mac OS/X 10.8.3 (thanks to [RogueJS][]).

First, I created a virtual environment in the Minecraft repo into which I will install pyglet.

    $ git clone https://github.com/joshsaintjacque/Minecraft.git
    $ cd Minecraft
    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate

Now download and install pyglet (1.1.4).

    $ cd ..
    $ hg clone https://pyglet.googlecode.com/hg/ pyglet
    $ cd pyglet
    $ python setup.py install

Supposedly the new pyglet 1.2 will fix these problems with its cocoa-based interface.  I did not try it.
